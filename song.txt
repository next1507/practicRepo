End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction

Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master
